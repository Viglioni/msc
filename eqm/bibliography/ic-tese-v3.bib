abstract={The Ring-LWE problem, introduced by Lyubashevsky, Peikert, and Regev (Eurocrypt 2010), has been steadily finding many uses in numerous cryptographic applications. Still, the Ring-LWE problem defined in [LPR10] involves the fractional ideal R{\thinspace}∨{\thinspace}, the dual of the ring R, which is the source of many theoretical and implementation technicalities. Until now, getting rid of R{\thinspace}∨{\thinspace}, required some relatively complex transformation that substantially increase the magnitude of the error polynomial and the practical complexity to sample it. It is only for rings R{\thinspace}={\thinspace}ℤ[X]/(Xn{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}1) where n a power of 2, that this transformation is simple and benign.},
